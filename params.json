{"name":"Install-rails","body":"# Installing Rails\r\n\r\nInstalling rails can be quite daunting for a beginner, and there is a good deal of bad documentation on the internet just waiting to trip you up. This is a simple, step by step guide to help you through the process.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, please get rid of any existing attempts to install rails (via apt, macports, etc). The methods provided will work, and are the preferred way that experienced rails developers use to get rails up and running on a machine. If you require help along the way, feel free to open an issue on http://github.com/mbriggs/install-rails/issues, ask a question on http://stackoverflow.com, ask questions in `#ruby` or `#rubyonrails` on freenode, or send an email to help@installrails.com.\r\n\r\nFeedback is always appreciated, as are pull requests. If you have any corrections to make or enhancements to add, you can fork this project at http://github.com/mbriggs/install-rails (just modify the README). For general feedback, fire off an email to feedback@installrails.com.\r\n\r\n*THIS GUIDE IS STILL IN BETA!*\r\n\r\nI still am in the process of writing and testing, so YMMV.\r\n\r\n# Installing Rails on OSX\r\n\r\nOSX is the operating system of choice for both ruby and rails developers. Support is excellent, and it should be easy to find help with any os specific problems you may encounter due to the fact that most of the community is using this operating system.\r\n\r\n### 1. Install GCC Toolchain\r\n\r\nGCC is an extremely popular C compiler that we will use to build ruby (and that ruby will use to build libraries that have C dependencies in the future).\r\n\r\nIf you are planning on doing any iOS/OSX development, your best choice is to just get it with XCode (the IDE for everything Apple). It can be downloaded for free off of the appstore, although it is quite a large download, so this can take some time.\r\n\r\nOnce it is installed, launch the application, and open its preferences (in the XCode menu, or press cmd-,). Click on the \"Downloads\" tab, and press the button that says \"Install\" next to \"Command Line Tools\"\r\n\r\nIf you do not plan on developing anything on Apples platforms, you can opt for the _much_ smaller GCC installer for OSX, which can be found here https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed gcc, you can make sure it is accessible by opening a new terminal, and entering `gcc -v`. You should see something resembling the following snippet\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n % gcc -v\r\nUsing built-in specs. Target: i686-apple-darwin11 Configured with: /private/var/tmp/llvmgcc42/llvmgcc42-2336.9~22/src/configure --disable-checking --enable-werror --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/llvm-gcc-4.2 --mandir=/share/man --enable-languages=c,objc,c++,obj-c++ --program-prefix=llvm- --program-transform-name=/^[cg][^.-]*$/s/$/-4.2/ --with-slibdir=/usr/lib --build=i686-apple-darwin11 --enable-llvm=/private/var/tmp/llvmgcc42/llvmgcc42-2336.9~22/dst-llvmCore/Developer/usr/local --program-prefix=i686-apple-darwin11- --host=x86_64-apple-darwin11 --target=i686-apple-darwin11 --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1 Thread model: posix gcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.9.00)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Installing Homebrew\r\n\r\nHomebrew is a tool for easily downloading and building libraries that you will need as a developer on OSX. You can install it with the following command\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(/usr/bin/curl -fksSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)\" \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo see that homebrew installed, try running the `brew` command. You should see something that looks like the following snippet\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n % brew\r\n Example usage:\r\n   brew install FORMULA...\r\n   brew uninstall FORMULA...\r\n   brew search [foo]\r\n   brew list [FORMULA...]\r\n   brew update\r\n   brew upgrade [FORMULA...]\r\n   brew [info | home] [FORMULA...]\r\n\r\n Troubleshooting:\r\n   brew doctor\r\n   brew install -vd FORMULA\r\n   brew [--env | --config]\r\n\r\n Brewing:\r\n   brew create [URL [--no-fetch]]\r\n   brew edit [FORMULA...]\r\n   open https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Formula-Cookbook\r\n\r\nFurther Help:\r\n  man brew\r\n  brew home\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Installing Ruby\r\n\r\nMost Rubyists use a tool called RVM (Ruby Version Manager) to install their ruby. The goal of the project is to allow one to switch between rubies easily, but it also has a set of very well maintained build scripts for the various versions of ruby on various operating systems.\r\n\r\nTo install rvm, run the following command in a new terminal \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbash -s stable < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will download and set up rvm for you. You should see some notes from wayne on how to use rvm show up on your screen. One of the notes will tell you to paste a line into your `.bashrc` file, which is required.\r\n\r\nYou can see that rvm is installed correctly by running `rvm -v`, which should show something like this\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrvm 1.10.3 by Wayne E. Seguin <wayneeseguin@gmail.com>, Michal Papis <mpapis@gmail.com> [https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that you have rvm, ruby is simple to install\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrvm install 1.9.3\r\n## -- rvm will download and compile ruby -- ##\r\nrvm 1.9.3 --default # switch to the new ruby, and make it your default\r\nruby -v # you should see something like \"ruby 1.9.3p125 (2012-02-16 revision 34643) [x86_64-darwin11.3.0]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4. Installing Rails\r\n\r\nNow that we have ruby, we will install rails the same way we install any ruby library -- with the `gem` command\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngem install rails\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo see that rails is working, create a new project\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrails new test-my-rails # create a new directory with a full rails setup\r\ncd test-my-rails\r\nbundle install # install all the project dependancies specified by your Gemfile\r\nrails server # start the rails server\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming all of that happened without error, open a browser and enter `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a page welcoming you to rails.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have a full rails development set up :)\r\n\r\n# So, what now?\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive, up to date (and free!) tutorial for Ruby on Rails, you can visit http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book\r\n\r\nFor a fun and interactive tutorial on ruby, you can visit http://tryruby.org\r\n\r\nFor a more thourough resource on learning ruby, I would recommend the excellent book, \"The Well Grounded Rubyist\" http://manning.com/black2/\r\n\r\nFor a more thourough resource on learning rails, I would recommend the excellent book \"Rails in Action\" http://manning.com/katz/\r\n","tagline":"Step by step instructions for how to install rails on OSX, Windows, and Ubuntu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
